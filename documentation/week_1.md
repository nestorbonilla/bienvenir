## Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?

Migrants in Central America (the description could be similar in other regions, but we need to validate it), when they leave their home country, they rarely have a clear path where to go, at which non-profit organization they can ask for support, and who is a person of trust to initiate a process of regulation (in the case of political migrants), and sadly it commonly occurs when they face scams, extortion, human rights violations, and human trafficking. This situation has strong consequences in the recipient country, creating a loop that is fueled by xenophobia, racism, and other forms of discrimination. On the other hand, we have non-profit organizations that are being allocated with a specific amount of money, but these resources are usually diluted in management expenses, and it is tough to make an accountable impact.

The third layer of complexity is added when an attempt to remove the middle man for direct transfer to beneficiaries is added. There’s a certain trust body that could verify among other things:
* if the person is real,
* if the person fulfills the requirements,
* if the person will make proper use of the allocated resources,
* if the person hasn’t committed any crimes in the home country (and this opens a controversial discussion because, in dictatorships, human right activists are accused of crimes that are usually invented).

These three layers, from my perspective, could be addressed with a platform of conditional transfer using a decentralized application, where through conditions, a migrant could be able to understand their new context through a series of courses, allowing them at the end to have access to legal support, creating a case by case compromise with lawyers (sign a smart contract) to give that support for a legal regulation (for example, an opportunity to be able to apply for a decent work, and not be an expense weight for recipient countries) in exchange of a payment that can be controlled by an economic amount designed to a smart contract. The legal implementation could be the first implementation, but this opens a whole new field of opportunity to make accountable the support of money allocations given to non-profit organizations that work with migrants in the region.

## What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?
Our target demographic is the Latin America area, divided by stages, being the first to address, the region of Central America.

## What are other solutions currently being used to address this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or processes that can compete with or substitute your product)

Other organizations are currently using solutions to address the migration and refugee topics, such as UNICEF, but none of them using Blockchain in Latin America. We also don't want to compete with the organizations; instead, we're looking to enhance their workflow by improving their impact metrics and articulating more organization in a coordinated decentralized way to address all of them the same topic. 

## What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?

Currently, the region of Central America is facing another migration era with historical picks due to the socio-political instability and human rights abuses. In this context, there's an evident need for new and innovative ways to address this problematic, but at the same time, this adds complexity layers that can be overcome with a proper articulation between non-profit organizations and government countries.
