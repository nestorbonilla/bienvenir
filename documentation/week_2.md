## Who are your constituents/clients/users? (Create User Persona(s))
* Our clients are local and international organizations that work with migrants in the Latin America region.
* Individual and law firms that work with migration topics.
* Our users will be migrants in the Latin America region.

## What are their pain points?
Local and international organizations that work with migrants have common challenges to read impact metrics of allocated resources to understand the traceability of a migrant since its arrival to the destination country and their barriers overcome with the support of the different programs these organizations have.

## What is your product's value proposition?
Our impact solution will be a decentralized automated impact measurement platform, where the support to migrants will pass through a series of steps, guaranteeing the optimal resource allocation by the completion of requirements that will train migrants to understand their reality, the challenges they have and the best way to overcome these barriers to be an agent of change and support the economy of the recipient country. As services this platform will offer:
* Identity verification of migrants for non-profit organizations.
* Management and funding resource tracking.

## What are your distribution and go-to-market strategy? Who can you partner with?
Our articulated go-to-market strategy is by direct contact to local and international organization that works with migrants in the Latin America region, and we will propose a partner alliance with OIM (their offices are in Panama, where the team leader resides).

## What are the risks associated with your solution?
We have identified two main risks:
* the lack of adaptability for new tools to migrants,
* the distrust migrants bring to the safekeeping of their personal information.

## What is the impact of your solution? How will it be measured?
Our impact will be an autonomous platform that will allow participant non-profit organizations to have a live impact measurement distributed by phase on their allocated resources for migrants in the Latin America region.
